      "Pros: -Great airport for connections to Africa and South America.-Has some really beautiful views.-Great fruit and fish.-Native Portuguese people are generally friendly and helpful.-Wonderful moderate climate (better than Spain)Cons:-The dirtiest major city I've seen in Europe. Filthy buildings and dog crap everywhere.-Unsafe - most other women I spoke to said they feel unsafe walking alone here (being leered at, whistled at and followed by the mostly immigrant men is a common occurrence). In the centre, you will be offered drugs every 10 minutes. -Property - the standard of accommodation in Lisbon is appalling. There's a real lack of decent apartments. Most are damp, with thin walls. As a result, to get a decent 1-bed European-standard apartment on a",
      "poor signaling, disorientation, cleaning and disorganizing of the streets in Lisbonis similar to Naples in my opinion",
      "It's great if you're woke, young & artsy. If you're just a regular guy in your 30's with no connections, you'll have a miserable time. Especially during the pandemic.It's not inexpensive and you get offered cocaine every 200 meters in the city center.",
      "Low-lifestyle, period, be AWARE of that. If you come with your miserly a*s for money and people working 24/7, you're definitely in the wrong place, stay in the your own country/culture, here is into quality of life, you have to adapt to the place and not him to please you as you wish, a plus if you can help to improve Portugal, but don't force it, respect the culture of others, respect Portugal!",
      "Lisbon and portugal reality its not a fairytale locals tell to expats and tourist only good things all good and nice but the reality is hiding like many portuguese try to do about expats and tourists, unfurnoly many locals dont want progress and evolution they always want be the same year by year",
      "Lisbon is the next remote work hub of Europe. There's many reasons why I think that:1) it already has somewhat of a startup/tech scene because of the annual Web Summit conference2) which means internet is fast, and there's lots of meetups and it's easy to make friends3) it's relatively affordable for foreigners compared to Spain and the rest of Europe4) Portuguese people are super friendly, a lot more friendly than in the rest of the Mediterranean and Europe5) Lisbon is ideal to go on day/weekend trips to beach towns like Ericeira which is just 30 minutes away6) Good airport with direct connections to Latin America, Europe and AsiaAnd in 2020 with COVID closing the borders in Asia, a lot of the nomads that would be there now, are in Portugal. And then once it gets cold here in December, they fly on to Tenerife. That seems to be the new game plan for European nomads.",
      "Please stop going to Lisbon, stop telling people to go Lisbon. It is a beautiful city, yes. The Portuguese people are some of the nicest, warmest I've ever had the privilege to meet, yes. But the housing crisis in Portugal is real and terrible.Airbnb and temporary accommodation for tourists / nomads, combined with rich foreigners who can afford exorbitant rents, are pushing locals out of their homes: literally. Search about the housing crisis, the police-enforced evictions of families and the elderly, the rising homelessness. The fact that the Portuguese are being driven out of their own towns and cities by a surge of foreign money and investment. There are stickers all around Lisbon that say, \"Airbnb: your holiday, our eviction.\" As a Portuguese friend said: \"Our average salary is 600-700\u20ac per month, average rent is at least 800\u20ac per month and climbing all the time thanks in large part to Airbnb, etc.\"Look at those figures and think about what that means.We lived in Portugal for six months in 2019 (staying with friends north of Lisbon). We left because we couldn't find anywhere to live long-term, even 1.5hrs from the city centre in any direction, and we didn't want to contribute to the unjust and truly inhumane situation we discovered once we looked deeper into the society. If you can afford insane rents and are happy that, in doing so, you may be taking someone else's home, go ahead. Otherwise, please, please think about the effect you're having. Lisbon really is amazing, and Portugal is a wonderful country with some astonishingly nice people. To keep it that way though, maybe we all need to stop treating it like our playground and start treating it like the Portuguese people's home.I'm sorry if this sounds harsh. But seriously, we're all in this world together. Please let's help to make it better.",
      "Great city with a really welcoming atmosphere. Its really a tech hub. There is an app which allows you to go to a different co working space once per week for free. Im staying at a co working hostel here and everyone is super friendly and welcoming. Bars and nightlife is not bad considering the pandemic, if you want to drink after midnight, you can join the masses of people on the top of the hill, and the police dont mind.",
      "I lived in many cities in both South and North Europe. I never found, until now, a better city for digital nomads than Lisbon.My experience there has been incredibly inspiring. Besides the great food and the affordable cost of living, I liked the most because it was effortless to meet like-minded people. A week after I arrived, I was already part of a soccer team, met two other people working in the same industry that I ended-up being close-friend and business-partner with, and had insightful conversations about my passions. I was surprised by how much Lisbon and Portugal have been able to attract so many great people. I'll definitely be back there soon",
      "Great vibe and lovely people (I was surprised at the number of foreigners even in January!), fun nightlife.Didn't find great cafes to work in, thankfully my hotel had decent internet.The only downside for me is the food, once you get tired of bacalhau (codfish), everything is very...beige especially when you don't eat meat. There are a couple of new cute vegan places but expect to pay a premium for those!",
      "One of my favourite cities. Lisbon is getting busier but it is a still an amazing nomad destination. Finding an Airbnb in the summer can be challenging but during the cooler months you can get amazing deals. Also staying at Outsite - the Coliving space is a great option for short term rentals as well and to get into the community of Lisbon. Every Thursday they have a nomad meet up - you can find it on Meetup the website. The cafes are great for working, yes the close early but that\u2019s what Lisbon is wonderful - a better work life balance than SEA where you can always be working essentially. My favourite cafes to work from are Dear Breakfast - lots of outlets, The Mill, Outside Cowork Cafe and Comoba. You can use the app Get Croissant (the class pass of coworking spaces) to use coworking spaces when you\u2019re on here temporarily. Overall I love Lisbon. Amazing food, nice people and ocean views from everywhere in the city. Absolutely love it!",
      "Really fun, but not such a good city for getting work done imo. Cafe's close early, lack of outlets in many locations now due to influx of digital nomads.",
      "Amazing place! Definitely one of the most underrated countries in western Europe.",
      "Culture, weather, sea, people, co-working spaces. Haven't found a better combination anywhere else.",
      "Definitely the place to be in western Europe. Great weather, solid food, pretty cheap, good internet, a lot of fun stuff to do, expats everywhere, English gets the job done, awesome day trips... I could go on and on.",
      "Most of the cafes are not suitable for working, they're small and crowded.",
      "Out of all the European places we lived in, Lisbon is our favorite and we plan on returning many times.",
      "Lisbon is not that inexpensive. I had wicked trouble with allergies in the buildings. They are not renovated properly and have issues with mold."

      "Berlin is overall a great city to be.Food is cheap and everywhere, easy to go out and have fun/meet for business.Rent has crept up but still far better value than where I came from.Internet: 36 EUR/month get me 450/40 mbps (cable -> DOCSIS 3.0)Public transport is 2.70 EUR/ticket.No woman I know has said they felt unsafe. Some really odd, xenophobic sounding comments on here.Biggest downsides IMO: service quality at restaurants - not that people are rude, but they don't seem to particularly carecash heavy - for people who value anonymity, Berlin is great - i wish i could go cashless more regularly",
      "I lived in Berlin for 2 years and have visited during the past 10 years on and off. I would say it's the most overrated city in all Europe. They have good marketing and spread of word advertising, but in reality its an uninspiring, ugly and depressing city with a weird energy that prevents people from getting things done. It's ok for 1 month in summer, but don't get stuck there. For women it's not safe at all, don't go to parks alone at night or empty U Bahn stations. In Berlin (and most big cities in Germany) young women are being raped by immigrants on a weekly base, its a know fact but politicians pretend it's not happening.",
      "I spent 1 month and 4 days in Berlin, Great the city, functional, no too crowded, a lot of things to see and to do.Good for business connections, reliable and affordable Public Transport ( even If I was advised a few times to don't fall in sleep in the trains ).On the other hand. It seems that a few places in Germany are not so well interconnected on Internet Network infrastructure.The speed was quite decent speed, but lost connectivity too often whatever I was using the phone or laptop.",
      "Berlin is great but Germany overall is extremely overrated - it is NOT by any means a modern, digitised, tech- nor expat- friendly country. It is grey, depressing, unwelcoming, filled with insanely hard to navigate bureaucracy and nonsensical \"rules\" about everything. Digitisation does not exist and everything has to be done still in person, via paper mail, by phone or fax. Internet speed is slow and wifi not widespread. Waiting times can be insane e.g. to get a doctor's appointment, and in general what takes minutes in another country can take weeks in Germany. And given that you get taxed on the air you breathe, I would say that this is hardly worth it. And if living in Berlin would make up for it five years ago thanks to the disgustingly cheap cost of life now that rent got thrice as expensive things have dramatically changed for the worse.",
      "Been living in Berlin for a couple of months. Not worth it anymore. Cold, gray, sad, more expensive than Cologne, terrible internet access (especially mobile), impossible to find decent mid-term apartments, everything getting 25% more expensive per quarter.",
      "Been living in 3 different centrally located airbnb in Berlin (2018), each between 800 and 900\u20ac per month for 40-45 sqm (we're two, so 400-450\u20ac each). Each time a full flat and not a shared airbnb, legal now since some months (though it was always possible to get a full flat before as well). Internet was always between 15 and 50 mbps. I spend 100\u20ac per week on food, including restaurants (pretty cheap here), check for Turkish market on Maybachufer and Turkish stores in Neuk\u00f6lln (I spend less on food here than in Chiang Mai!). Berlin is such an awesome place to live, very multicultural, very tolerant, many different neighborhoods, quite relaxed feeling, many parks, lakes all around. No need to speak German at all. Come over here, probably one one of the best place on earth ;) (written in Sept 2018)",
      "The internet sucks in Berlin and is definitely not fast. I don\u2019t know where you get your numbers from but I\u2019m sure you were never in the country for very long and are using the \u201eofficial numbers\u201c not the real ones.",
      "Rent a bike using the many dockless bike sharing and enjoy the parks. Berlin is amazing during summer. Betahaus is great to meet other nomads. No need for having a membership, just go to their cafe. Checkout Meetup.com for many opportunities to meet people. AirBnB is ok but pricey, and since 2016 they are not allowed to rent flats, but only rooms. The vibe in Berlin is is usually relaxed and alternative. Falafel and doner are always an option for cheap eating.",
      "Berlin is an amazing city. The two main problems of Berlin are the German way of acting and people that moves there trying to be too cool to take a shower."

    "Reviews": [
      "Cons:- Traffic was something else!- Shiddy air quality from half the neighbors burning their trash.- The honking was super stressful, it's so loud even when you're at home or at a restaurant.- Many of the roads are really narrow which would've been fine if it wasn't for the congestion; crazy number of people on the roads. - Beaches = dog crap on your shoes, every time.- Villas get robbed super often, you read about it happening all the time on the Canggu fb page, but also saw it happen in the daytime.- Overpriced restaurants and supermarkets.- Staying in the overpopulated areas of Bali is necessary if you require good internet for work.Pros:- Surf is obviously great, the line ups can get very busy though.- The locals are much friendlier than in Thailand (unless you plan on seeing a volcano, lol)- Cheap grocery deliveries from market vendors!My initial reaction wasn't great, but after a year I couldn't wait to escape Bali.",
      "Bali is amazing, but Canggu isn't really that great -- actually there are SO MANY better places, like Uluwatu, Gili Islands or even Ubud that I can't understand the hype. As almost everyone said below, beaches are crappy, roads are terrible, sidewalks are non-existent and having a motorbike is a must. On the other side, food is great and cafes are pretty reasonable with all those incredible bowls. Anyway I wouldn't recommend it for more than a week.",
      "Spent a few weeks in Canggu and couldn't wait to leave. Packed with hipster wannabees and douchebag surfers mixed with a few pretentious dropshipppers and the like. Roads are terrible with not lights at night and both locals and foreigners drive like crazy. Beach is pretty crap compared to say Thailand or Philippines. Local food it not very good and the hipster cafes etc are way overpriced. With so many beautiful placed in the world why anyone would spend time in Canggu is beyond me.",
      "I've been here for 5 months and have mixed feelings about Canggu.Weather: Since rainy season let up the weather has been exceptional. Sunny and warm with a nice breeze. I can\u2019t say enough about how dreamy the weather is here. Food: Food scene is fabulous. You can get like high quality food of all kinds for well under $10. Local food will run you maybe $2 if you stack your plate high. The food is a major selling point, especially in Canggu. Also, with the covid situation, GoJek and Grab have been really nice to have as the delivery prices are low.Coworking: (sigh) I tried one coworking place, and decided my guesthouse had good enough wifi for me to work at. Plus the cafe culture here is unreal so there\u2019s always fun places to work. BUT if I\u2019m paying $150/month for a workspace, why isn\u2019t the entire place temperature controlled? It is nearly 40 degrees with the heat index almost every single day here and they put fans up in a closed building? Too hot for me and too hot for my laptop! So I don\u2019t have a great review for coworking but the speed at my guesthouse and coffee shops worked just fine.Accommodation: I stayed at at a small guesthouse about 10 minutes inland from Echo beach. It\u2019s cheap, but fine. Usually, the further inland, the cheaper. My only gripe is they don\u2019t clean well, and I\u2019ve developed an indoor dust and dander allergy since coming here. I just spend most of my time outside now, but not ideal. If I were to do it over again, I\u2019d find a brand new place to live in. The cleaning standards are very low in bali so keep an eye out when you look at places to rent. Availability of \u201chome\u201d comforts: For being a small island in the middle of the ocean, you can find pretty much anything in Canggu. You can also order stuff online from Lazada and Tokopedia. I found it really easy to find some western comforts if I really needed them. Traffic:(another sigh) Traffic is dizzying at best. Driving a motorbike is fun for the adrenaline junkie in me and if you haven\u2019t been in a motorbike accident before, the odds are high you\u2019ll be in one here. If you\u2019re in Canggu, keep Siloham Medical Center as a saved place in your google maps in case, they take really good care of people. Also, the pollution is absolutely awful. So even without covid I began wearing a mask.Vibe: There\u2019s good people everywhere and I\u2019ve made friends easily as there are tons of digital nomads and just generally alot of people here. Overall though, if you\u2019re not a trustafarian or like real into looking cool on social media, Canggu is not for you my friend. The vibe of the place is just really manufactured. Gili Islands are just a few hours out and Lombok as well, so there\u2019s places to get away. With all of this said, I likely won\u2019t be back. I adore South East Asia and have traveled it extensively but Canggu just is not for me.",
      "I don't know why everybody is so mad about Bali. There are a lot of good points here. But there are also many issues: traffic is terrible, Internet is slow, good property and healthy food is not so cheap, local governments are corrupt and will try to charge you for any small thing! \u0421ustoms was very rude and searched me at the airport for 2 hours without even telling me a reason!",
      "The center of nomads in the world right now. Amazing food, great cafes and pool parties. A mix of internet entrepreneurs, Instagram models and influencers living in poolside villas. This isn't a place to go for local and authentic, it's not that but that's okay in the case of Canggu, it's something else.",
      "Way too overrated hipster central/instagram influencers ghetto.Probably it was good 10 years ago, but once everyone and their dog is talking about a place, then it is usually time to leave.Not my cup of rice all in all.",
      "Spent 2 weeks here. Liked Ubud better, but if you're more of a surfer, you'll like it here, although it's a bit crowded (in terms of nomads) at this point. Food is good and cheap and so is accommodation.",
      "It's a cool place to stay for a while, get to know people at Dojo or Tropical Nomad, work a bit, eat some good food. But it is not relaxing at all. Noisy, dirty, hot, humid. The beach is also not super beautiful or clean. If you don't surf, or are not into beach bars and party, there is not much for you there. Loved to wake up really early when the air was a bit fresher and fewer people on the streets: that was my favorite Canggu, but that is not what Canggu really is. After one month I was ready to leave.",
      "Cons:- Beaches are filthy- Oppressively hot (except June-Sep)- Unsanitary for such a popular tourist destination- Congested traffic, small roads, constant scooter noisePros:- Amazing health and wellness community- Great healthy vegan food options- Amazing networking. Nomad community is always #1 or #2 on Nomadlist- Some of the best gyms in the world all within 2x2 square km",
      "Personally I hated it. Being somewhat of a SEA vet, I found it crowded, over touristed, expensive and with too many annoying hipsters. You can't walk ten feet without a scooter blocking your path and a red eyed local going \"Taxi?\" Literally every ten feet in Semniyak. Canggu maybe isn't so bad, but still the traffic is annoying. The roads are super small and traffic is horrible. If you're into walking places, Canngu isn't for you. You'll get run over. So either drive a scooter or get used to dealing with the taxi mafia. There's a war between them and ride hailing apps at the moment. So when you call a grab, after he drops you off there's a chance he'll be beaten to death. But this is normal around the world at the moment, for less affluent countries anyway. Pros? It's beautiful. Lots of stuff to see and do. Unfortunately you'll be charged money for literally everything, including walking through rice paddies. The landscapes, the architecture. I know Bali is a big island with a lot to do. You can rent a villa for $1200 usd a month and live like a drug dealer with your own indoor swimming pool. So gather four nomads and have your own gated compound. Lots of nightlife, clubs, if you're into that stuff. I'm not. For parties I'd rather go to a beach place with hippies in Thailand. The local food is good, the tourist food is amazing if you're willing to pay western prices. But the quality is very high. Overall it's not an expensive place, but it can be. I know Bali is a huge island but I'm just referring to Canggu. It's just to westernized for me. Too crowded with westerners. But if you want to go meet nomads and do western priced fitness, meditation and yoga classes it's the place to be. Plus the beaches are super polluted. Argh. I couldn't wait to leave. I doubt I'll be back soon. But if I do I'm definitely renting a villa and learning to surf. Cool place to do business. But not a place I'd want to live for long. Maybe I'll give it another chance one day.",
      "Excellent place to start your nomadic life, very very easy living here. For example, having your laundry washed and folded for you is about $3 USD, eating out very healthy about $6-7 USD, and co-working spaces about $120 USD. It has been a very soft landing for starting this lifestyle.",
      "+ startup event, good food, a lot of gyms, party, - pollution, and each year more expensive",
      "Oppressively hot. Actually hard to find Balinesian food. There is a lot of overpriced, average, western, hipster food. People are incredibly kind and the Balinesian food is great when you can find it. The roads are ridiculously crowded while a lot of the restaurants, bars, and clubs were less than 30% full. Kind of sad for local business owners. Surrounding area is beautiful and relatively accessible. Aside from western food & beverage lodging, food and beverage can be very cost effective. Other parts of the island are better for experiencing the Balinesian life, but it is more of a challenge to mix socially with local people here than other places as most people work in service industries or agriculture. It is what it is. In the end, if you like oppressive heat & humidity, western millennial cuisine, crowded roads, and a small beach, this may be your place.",
      "There are definitely much better places for digital nomads. Been in Canggu for 2 months (2019) and its turning into another Kuta since there are so many tourists and its not even high season yet. Something like Ibiza in Europe. Also Internet is NOT stable. Rented a place with 40 mbit but it was on 5 most of the time. Even the coworking spaces are not always stable although you are looking at 15 usd or more to pay there for a day. This is more a party holiday place now. Lots of rich kids aka trustafarians. Food can be quite expensive too. Many places you will easily spend 7 usd for a breakfast. Alc is expensive here too compare to most of SE Asia. Not sure how somebody can say this is the number one spot. All in all happy to leave.",
      "The review that begins \"Canggu is great. Here's some pointers you need to know before going:\" is exactly 100% spot-on except... its not great. Motorbikes are dangerous and there are so many incredibly dangerous tourists on motorbikes either showing off on overpowered bikes or not knowing what they're doing and crashing. I've been crashes and near-misses almost every day. Had someone crash into me just yesterday. Walking is impossible and incredibly dangerous. Its not worth your life to be in a place with filthy beaches, filthy streets and incredible noise pollution from clubs and made-to-be-loud motorbikes. There are some incredibly, incredibly hot Western women but I don't like living like a colonialist. I've never seen an Indonesian in the same restaurant or pool or anything as me. That's creepy. If you miss The Raj, then its probably great for you but I like living among the local people. Not them being only servants with nothing about the place left to enjoy themselves.",
      "Canggu is the best amongst other SE Asian area for chilling and working remotely.",
      "Canggu is great. Here's some pointers you need to know before going:1) You HAVE TO to drive a motorbike/scooter. Canggu has no sidewalks and walking on the road is very dangerous. If you ride a bicycle you're also just endangering yourself. Drive a bike. Traffic isn't necessarily safe. But if you drive 30km/h you'll be OK. Don't drink and drive, most ppl die because of that. 2) Yes it's very Western. Canggu is essentially a 2-by-2 km resort full of expats, foreigners, nomads and tourists. Locals staff the restaurants, bars and coworkings. It's not unlike a resort in Mexico in that way. Good? I don't know, but it's how it is.3) Canggu has some of the best international food you can imagine. Italian chefs making Michelin-level food. Amazing pizzas at Crust for $5. Japanese sushi and ramen. Many chefs left their home countries to live in Bali and opened up restaurants here.4) Canggu nightlife is improving fast. It used to be only Old Man's and then a party on the beach with the same Spotify pop playlist every night. But now we're seeing techno clubs like Volt and many more open. Very good.5) Traffic is really annoying. There's just too many loud dangerous motorbikes and scooters on too narrow roads driving too fast. And often a giant car clogging everything up in there too. Canggu will kill itself if it doesn't fix this. Canggu needs a ban on petrol bikes, only allow electric bikes, set speed limits that are enforced and promote bicycle usage. Cars should be banned altogether, it's just too small for it. But apart from that it really is one of the most ideal places to be now. I think what I like most is the people that Canggu attracts. It's creatives and entrepreneurs mostly.Visit it, get a bike and explore Canggu. Stay for at least a few weeks before judging it. It's not the easiest place to start off and that's purposely to keep the noobs out. Enjoy!",
      "Canggu is a hipster paradise with a vast digital nomade community, health foods, and fitness. Want to be a tourist? Go to Kuta or Seminyak. Want to surf? Go to Uluwatu. Want yoga and fasting retreats? Go to Ubud. Want to be part of a community that lives and breaths for arts, entreprenureal ideas, and a lifestyle of hitting the health foods, secret beach spots, and soul searching? Canggu is the place. Many westerners have settled here, and prices can reflect this unless you take the time to pinpoint the local warungs and guest houses. Not family friendly. CrossFit scene is epic.",
      "Shittiest European Clique",
      "Waves are shit, water is dirty and there's like a thousand kooks from Europe on longboards in the water fighting for that occasional 1ft mushy wave.Better off going to Uluwatu or Padang for real waves.Indonesia got some of the worlds best waves, but Canggu shouldn't even be regarded as a surf spot.",
      "I have been there only one time but it was really chilly",
      "This is really great place to be as a digital nomad. It's not insanely Thailand/Laos cheap however if you're a bit older, 30+ and have a moderately successful business its a steal. If you've done Thailand, Laos, Vietnam etc and want a professional alternative to a backpacker lifestyle then Bali is for you. Internet is great. Food is insanely good, people are very nice- expats + locals. Really glad I found this place. Dojo has awesome wifi :)",
      "Dirty beaches, though I heard it's different depending on the time of year. Good food, lots of vegan/veg/clean options. No swimming at all, but good surfing. More expensive than I expected.",
      "I think Canggu is a good place for working remotely. The good points are that it is cheap to eat healthy and sleep in nice places, if you are acting ok with the balineses and majority of people living in Canggu, you will find them really nice. You can surf, hike, drive motorbike in beautiful rices fields. You might want to find peace and (for exemple) interest yourself in the meditation stuff or you can party like.. a lot ! For Digital Nomading aspects: There is a lot of coworking/coliving spaces and digital nomads to meet and discuss with around the island. For Safety: Driving in motorbike can be tricky and dangerous in Bali but it might be the first option you'll have if you stay there (or you take motorbike-taxi everytime). BE SURE TO STAY SAFE AND INSURED - Eat in places you trustConsider: The island just had a touristic boom in the last years and the authenticity of the island might not be preserved at this rythm. Take care of Bali if you visit it.",
      "Vastly overrated. Infrastructure is bad, not densely populated so dating is difficult. Roads are too narrow and congested. The Internet is pathetic. Expensive beer taxed by the Muslim regime and every bill has 20% tax. Amazed this place can be so well regarded. Thailand and Vietnam are far better in SE Asia for everything. Would rather rough it in Cambodia than stay here.",
      "I don't know why this place is ranked so high. It is not cheap, not safe, the internet is craptastic, and the beaches are filthy.",
      "Watch out for the bag snatchers at night, it never happened to me but I've heard some stories. Better to just wear a backpack, because they won't try to snatch that.",
      "What started out as a fishing village with just a few shacks on the beach became a surfer's hotspot around 2005. Surfers would stay in Seminyak and drive north to Canggu's Echo Beach to catch waves. Around 2008, there was the first remote working nomads arriving. Mostly Eastern European and Russian programmers who'd work from Canggu's then few cafes.After the digital nomad explosion of 2014, many nomads sprawled to Bali and settled down in Ubud. Meanwhile in Canggu, the first coworking space there opened called Salty Volt. It didn't manage to attract many people though and finally closed down. Canggu just wasn't ready yet, with only a few cafes and restaurants, and well, people. It took 2 years for Canggu to get back on the radar and when Ubud's coworking spaces and cafes started getting crowded in 2016, people started mentioning Canggu again. In those 2 years, the Salty Volt had now become Dojo, had a new owner, there was now lots of hip cafes, restaurants with European chefs, and the vibe in Canggu was now a more ambitious and fashionable version of Ubud. Where Ubud was for hippies, Canggu was for hipsters.From 2016 on, every year more and more people started to move to Canggu. In late 2017, it became so popular with nomads that for the first time Dojo had to deny new memberships. At the same time, it started becoming a hotspot for Instagrammers, who'd rent luxury villas with flamingo floats and snap pictures. In turn, this started attracting more tourists and have now made Canggu the most popular spot in Bali for nomads. For now, at least."

    "Reviews": [
      "I'm the one who left the review complaining about how people don't speak English 2-3 months ago. I think it's only fair to leave another review as I projected a pretty negative overall picture of the place. I came back a second time and boy, I'm glad I did. The language barrier didn't disappear, but I came with a different mindset and made efforts to learn some basic Spanish. Being able to explain how you want your coffee even makes a huge difference. Mexican people are kind and warm-hearted. Of course, no one will hug you on the street and people keep to themselves just as in western societies, but on encounters with others, they are much more compassionate. You can definitely feel the Latin vs. the first-world vibe. It's far from perfect, but it is very authentic. If you come humble, put your ego aside, and be accepting of a new culture, you may find yourself leaving with strong feelings for the place, some sadness for leaving, and a warm feeling in your heart at the thought of coming back next time.",
      "If you stay in Roma or Polanco you'll be fine. Mexico City was a little too chaotic for my taste, but also had some really beautiful and cool neighborhoods and a must visit if you find yourself in the middle of Mexico. Uber runs here so that makes it easy to get around.  It can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be, a decent hostel will run you $15 - $20/night. I cook many of my meals and prefer to splurge at nice restaurants a few nights a week vs eating at cheap places for every meal. Groceries run about $30-$50/week and a decent meal with a drink or 2 for me was around $20-$30. (you can eat for pennies here - I'm a bit bougie when it comes to eating out) As a female solo traveler I didn't feel safe being out past dark alone, but other people felt fine. Worst part for me was the air quality best part was the cheap flights out of Mexico City ha.",
      "It's not dangerous if you stay in the right areas. No one speaks English. I mean no one. If you don't speak Spanish, be prepared to use GoogleTr. / sign language / no habla espanol all the time, and also being laughed at while trying to explain yourself. AirBnB is super expensive. The government puts a very high tax on the accommodations. Overall, these shortened my stay significantly, I intended to stay for long but after less than a month I was anxious to leave to a place where I can at least communicate on a basic level with people.",
      "We stayed here for two months. This was an amazing experience. I plan to move back for a longer time.We came here from Los Angeles, we lived in Polanco and Roma, both great but I would recommend Roma as it has a younger crowd, a bit more active, and cheaper. Even with going out to dinner several times a week still found a hard to spend beyond $25 USD for a meal, even in more expensive neighborhoods like Polanco with amazing food around every corner!!It felt very safe and there were police officers everywhere. I think in an effort to make sure everyone feels safe in the capital. In addition, the public transit and subway system is great and very clean for the size of the city!! I've used public transit in most major global cities and have lived in NYC.",
      "Came to CDMX from NYC. Lived in a bunch of cities around the US. CDMX is my favorite. That being said, it's still Latin America. Take precautions. I grew up in the NYC area around the gangs and stuff of the 90s and 00s. Here are a few tips to strongly consider1) Live in Polanco, no farther north than Juarez, no father south than Escandon (unless you're going to Coyocan), no farther east than Roma or Doctores. All assuming you want to be near some action. Don't listen to these wannabe \"woke\" people. These areas the cops tend to be around and about. As well as other tourist and likes of. 2) Uber everywhere thats too far to walk. Definitely at night. From Escandon to Roma is about 40 pesos (2 USD). While, the metro is much cheaper, there's a reason they have a female only car. Also you have to really know here you're going3) The people here are awesome. Made some solid friends. Just be careful and don't be too trusting. To an American, 200 usd is good money but nothing to commit a crime over. Here, that is some people monthly income. I personally know a buddy of mine who got set up and almost robbed. Just be careful.I do love it here and have 0 plans on leaving. Just don't walk around like its all safe.",
      "I do love Mexico City, it's incredibly vibrant with friendly people.That said, I will warn against following advice from people who go for a few months and say, \"it's safe because I never had an issue\". This is Latin America and it is known to be dangerous for a reason, statistically, even Mexico City is very unsafe. The chance of something dangerous happening goes up the longer you stay, only you can decide if that's worth it.",
      "Mexico City is a blast and at a decent price. Safety wise, it's much like any other big city: be careful where you go at night. There's plenty of great food throughout the city with much to do during the day and at night (YES to Lucha Libre!).",
      "Mexico City is perfectly safe. I've lived in areas like Doctores and Guerrero and never had an issue. $1300 per month is inaccurate. You can get a 1 bed studio or apartment for less than $400. The 'living like a local' cost is perfectly achievable, why would it be $800 more for a nomad? Narvarte and Napoles are perfect areas to stay.Stay away from typical areas like Condesa if you actually want to feel like a local. All you'll get in Condesa is overpriced bars, gringos and muggings because thieves know people spending $1300 will go there!Don't listen to people saying get Uber. Waste of time. The Metro is 5 pesos and much faster. You're not going to get murdered.",
      "it's a great place to live and i recommend to visit it just to check it out.We came here on our way from Playa del Carmen to USA and loved it so much that we decided to live there.",
      "Great food and affordable Airbnbs in decent neighborhoods! What more could you ask for! Highly recommend Mexico City if you're passing through LATAM.",
      "Amazing, amazing, amazing. I initially arrived there for 2 weeks with an intention for it to be just a transit stop, but stayed there for 3 months. Stay in the right areas (Condesa, Roma, Coyoca, Polanco, Coyocan, etc), take Uber and take basic precautions. It's a lovely town with endless food options and work options. Accomodations are not cheap by Mexican standards, but very affordable comparing to USA. It's just a great place to live, in my opinion.The only thing that is bad is quality of the air (not everywhere, though, but in general). If you are sensible to a bad air - take a trip and see how you adjust to it. It's a big issue, yes, but I feel like the are much more pros than cons.Viva Mexico!",
      "Important to stay in the right areas, and air pollution can be an issue. Budget lots of time for this place -- there are so many people to meet and things to do! Transportation can require a bit more advance planning than elsewhere due to traffic.",
      "The digital nomad hotspot of Latin America now, far surpassing Medellin recently. It's like the Bangkok of America. It's very cheap, very fun and relatively safe now (if you stay in the right areas)."

    "Reviews": [
      "I spent one year in Istanbul and it's absolutely amazing. The city is really safe, I went back home really late during the night, walking, without any problem. Parties are really fun and there are all kinds of spots to have fun (bars, nightclubs, restaurants...). The city has a lot of caf\u00e9s to work at and most of them have free and reliable wifi. Definitely recommend!",
      "As any other city, there are its pros and cons. Of course, it is not a village where everyone will be nice and smile at you if you expect this. Large cities are usually cold and people are quite disconnected. However, the beauty of the culture compliments everything. I suggest having a right intention when coming to Istanbul. If you're looking to make new friends, this is probably not your place to pick (as people are pretty cold), but if you want to enjoy your life, live in your own pace - go to islands to swim, see historical places, walk on your feet a lot, go to cool restaurants and very vivid coffee shops (the variety, is wow!!). As you enter your routine, people will follow and you will connect with some as well that it is not going to be lonely.",
      "Beautiful, affordable, and historic. Downsides are that Turkish people can be often very casually racist and culturally insensitive, especially if you are an ethnic minority and/or a woman. I've also been followed on multiple occasions by random men on the streets. But don't let this take away from your experience of the place as I've experienced some of the best hospitality, food, and sights this world has to offer. There are plenty of cafes and public spaces with reliable wifi where you can get work done.",
      "Spent six months in Istanbul in 1993 when Turkey was really exotic. Didn't return till 2007, when I made mostly Kurdish friends in Sultanahmet, whom I'd see on frequent visits thereafter. Otherwise, I'd skip the city as like throughout Turkey bar the Kurdish areas there's anti Western feeling and targeting of visitors (I noticed that after a meal with alcohol, I'd nearly always be approached by a single male in the street near the restaurant inviting me to a bar certain. I'd suggest going to the first busy caf\u00e9 instead, at which point they'd excuse themselves. I suspect some waiters were part of a scam targeting single males).",
      "It's most historical city with most rude people!!you always be careful to not to be stupid",
      "I planned to go there next spring !",

      "Tbilisi is a beautiful place to be at. It is really cheap and nice. People are warm and welcoming, even though they are more friendly in the villages. It is a really cool place with many shops to buy things at that is well located. Also, you can get pretty quickly to nature.",
      "We had some crazy situations with apartments scam - so please everyone be aware, that there are people pretending an RE agent. Always do a checkup of a realtor you are contacting. And the statement below that georgian people like to be 'dramatic'. Never experienced so much drama in my life, as from georgian landlords during 6 months of staying in Tbilisi ;)I disagree with one of the reviews that Tbilisi has no parks. Actually it's super ridiculous thing to say about Tbilisi! The city has plenty of green spaces (Vera Park, Mtatsminda mountain, Turtle Lisi Lake and magical Mziuri and don't forget to mention Vake, where you can climb up the hill and you feel like you just transported yourself outside of the city in ~5mins ). Actually PARKS are my favourite in Tbilisi - because of them, as well as big sidewalks to walk (unseen in Chiang Mai for sure). Person who wrote about the lack of parks had to live on the wrong side of the river - only go for districst like Vera, Vake, Saburtalo and there the choice of parks is broad. What I didn't like about Tbilisi? I confirm that locals are unfriendly. City is very noisy (drivers are agressive, have no respect to pedestrians and beep a lot). Georgian goverment wants foreigners in their country so badly but locals mentality (very post soviet one) is not ready. They only want to get your money and the best would be if you dissapear just afterwards. Also you will have hard time to eat out as vegeterian - vegan. Places fully \"green\" are just a few. In other spots you can eat salads/chaciapuri which is cheese + carbs (for a vegan stays cucumber tomato salad - i wish you luck getting full with it :D).",
      "I've been living in Tbilisi for 7 months.The most surprising thing about the city was the welcoming expat community which is larger than I expected. Quality, well travelled people that are generally older (30's+). I met many good friends in a very short period of time.The downtown area of the city is not ideal and can be noisy and polluted but the suburbs (only a 10min cab ride away), especially upscale Vake, is a better option in my opinion. It has a large beautiful park, lovely shops, restaurants and bars. Rent here is still quite cheap. All apartments are rented out fully furnished. You can get a nice large flat for as low as 200usd but 400 will get you a large modern flat.Internet is very fast, up to 100mbps for about 30usd per month.There are also many international restaurants but you may not find it as authentic as in other major cities.Locals are not friendly generally speaking except in the villages. Communication in English can be difficult but not impossible.Settling here for short or longer term is very easy, you can open a bank account and work legally on your visa on arrival. Banks like Bank of Georgia offer savings accounts for 3 months in the local currency with an 11.5% interest rate!Safety is not an issue for most unless you go to the dodgier bars but at most they will rip you off. As a woman I feel totally safe night and day.Drivers are aggressive but taxi's are cheaper than anywhere I've ever been to (about 2usd for a 15 minute ride) which you can get quickly and easily on Bolt or Yandex apps.Overall cost of living is very cheap. You can easily live on less than 1000usd per month and still go out and have fun.Also the country has handled covid very well and is one of the best countries to ride out the wave, everything is nearly back to normal, borders still closed in mid June.Weather is mild, even in winter it's not too bad, heating and air-conditioning works well.I really like it here!",
      "I've lived in Tbilisi for one month. In short: the foundations are here for a great and low cost place to work. But the city lacks liveability (parks, healthy food, noisy, polluted).The pro's: It is easy to get a visa, has a growing expat community, easy to arrange mobile plan, gym, housing, etc and its all super cheap. Its perfect for bootstrapping and costwise even on par with Chiang Mai. Its also easy to take trips to the mountains and Armenia and taxi's itself are incredibly cheap. The city has a growing number of gems to eat, shop and drink.Even though all the pro's above I personally wouldn't return. Besides expats it was difficult to make connections. The locals can be rude at times and love being dramatic and driving illogically big SUV's. The city was noisy, dirty and it was difficult finding places to run or relax since parks are non-existent and streets are in bad shape. Cheese, meat and wine sounds great at first but it gets boring real fast and it was difficult to eat healthy.",
      "I've lived in Tbilisi for three months. I started in Kutaisi (fly cheaply to Kutaisi with WizzAir) for a few days before hiking through the Svaneti region for four days. Highly recommend getting to the Caucasus!If you're looking to bootstrap while you retrain yourself or start your online business, then Tbilisi is a great option. I've spent less in Tbilisi than I did in Chiang Mai. They speak better English than what some may suggest. I've gotten the wrong order a few times, but other than that, I have not had a problem with communicating. Internet is copious. I recommend Hurma and Althaus Tea Room for a couple great cafes to work from.I found Georgians to be rather unfriendly, and it was difficult to make any local friends. Tbilisi is the worst city for gay life that I have ever been to, so if you're LGBT then don't expect much. On the other hand, Tbilisi is exceptionally safe. I walked home alone from the bar at 3 AM on several occasions and never felt any unease. Ohh, and the drivers in Tbilisi are aggressive, and the cars approach pedestrians too closely. Lastly, Georgian ATMs do not charge a fee and the exchange rates are at market rate. So with my Schwab account, I was able to pull money out completely free. Good and bad as with any city, but I will definitely return to Tbilisi, especially with the 1 year tourist visa and Ryan Air's new routes in Tbilisi.",
      "Lived here for 3 months. Fantastic. Special mentions to Rooms Hotel for the best late-night coding and coffee lounge, Urban Garden for best reasonably-priced gym, Restaurant Tiflis (by the bridge), Duqani, Shatre, and Machahkela resturant chain for inexpensive but great food, and Skola Coffee + Book Corner Cafe (opposite Restaurant Tiflis) for best daytime cafes you can work at. Best ice cream (by FAR): The Cone Culture.Georgians are very friendly and hospitable. It's also the first ex-Soviet country to legalise \ud83c\udf41, if you're that way inclined (you'll find Georgians willing to share nearly everywhere.)However it's an Eastern European country and still poor, you gotta be careful.I recommend you open a local bank account with TBC Bank (very easy process) and then use Transferwise to exchange into GEL.(connect with me: scaur.nz)"

      "I have been living in Porto since September. Portugal is currently in a hard covid lockdown so Porto is not at its best. But in better times the city is amazing. Beautiful, right near the beach, with excellent air and rail connectivity. English is widely spoken and the accommodations for visitors are diverse and excellent. Restaurants are also diverse and excellent. Prices for those used to northern Europe or USA will seem low. December, January are very rainy and can get cold, down to nearly 0\u00b0C. Many units do not have heaters or only electric ones, so may be uncomfortable in winter. And it can rain for over a week straight. However at all other times of the year the climate is amazing. Porto merits its high digital nomad ranking!",
      "Better than Lisbon, much more cozy and welcoming. You can find cheaper places in the \u201cother side of the bridge\u201d, in the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia. Public transports works and is pretty convenient, most part of the city is covered by tram stations. Beaches are freezing cold but nice for a running. Don\u2019t miss the daily sunsets in the garden nearby the bridge, eating pastel de nata and drinking a bottle of Porto Wine. But please, don\u2019t clap your hands to the sun \u2014 only Brazilian tourists do that haha",
      "Porto is simply amazing! Really good food, easy atmosphere, nice people, affordable, and great to do some work as well! The amazing history this place has adds to the total, including it being easy to travel south to Coimbra and Lisbon.",
      "Spent 3 years living in Porto, must say it's maybe the best city I've lived in so far. Its super hospitable people, delicious food, good English speaking and well educated population, entrepreneurship opportunities and cheap (comparing to Lisbon) cost of living make a combination that is quite hard to beat in Europe."

      "Don't believe the prices on here for an apartment. 686 usd/month refers to an apartment in a high class condo, right in the city centre and seconds away from the BTS(train station). Just remember this, people working at supermarkets make 2 usd/per hour. If you want to live like a local, then you can save a lot of money. If you don't mind a 5-10 minute walk from the BTS, then you can easily get a one bedroom apartment for 300 USD per month, in a high class condo, plus with free golf cart service to the BTS station. I have literally gone to a restaurant to pay 8 USD for a meal, when the exact dish was available on the street for only 1 USD and tastes much better. I ate out everyday and went partying a couple of times a week, and my total monthly expenses was still under 1000 usd. TIPS-Gyms are fucking expensive in Thailand. Expect to pay at least 60 USD/month for the gym, which is crazy when you consider the average wage in Thailand is 15 usd/per day. -Vitamins and supplements cost double the price than what you would get at home. Thais do not take supplements. Maybe only foreigners and really rich Thais. People spending 1500 USD per month must be eating steak daily and hanging out at places meant for foreigners.",
      "Cost of living over 1.000 usd? Is any of of this website went to Bangkok? You can live on a palace above 1.000 usd rent. Mine was 22.000 bahts and was in the party street, amazing building with jacuzzi, pools and even its own cinema..",
      "One of my favourite cities in the world for being a nomad. A great blend of both local and foreign population. Anything you could possibly want to eat or buy is in this city. Plenty of nightlife to be found (12x12 is a hidden gem I love). Most foreigners you meet are there to have a good time, there's just a laid back and comfortable vibe to the whole city. Traffic is horrible, so recommend the train whenever you can, or GrabBikes, which will allow you to weave between the traffic unlike any bus or taxi. However, the city is getting increasingly more expensive over the years. Don't expect to be living dirt cheap like other southeast Asian spots.",
      "I traveled around from 2007 to 2010: North and South America, Europe and Asia, staying a minimum of a month (often 2 months) in each country. My work was online and I wasn't looking to settle but when I came to Bangkok on the last day of major political unrest, I was shocked by how nice people were... If kindness of local people, manners and respect for your personal space mean anything to you, you will love Bangkok. Since 2010, I lived in condos and rented buildings in Bangkok and all is very easy, a smile and showing good will open most doors. Even dealing with burocracy is simple if you dress up and are polite - I've never met a Thai who didn't want to help. After living for 20+ years in NYFC, this was a shocking surprise... Bangkok is great for: independent people who want access to everything. You can live here on $10 a day or a $1000 a day and still can spend more. Try doing that in other places... There is a lot of money in Thailand so there are many startups, jobs (very, very low unemployment), lots of expats and internationals. Bangkok is not great for: people who expect it to be something else, people who are rude, aggressive (A types) who can't wait or who need things to be done immediately. This is not a place where you come in and expect things to work how you expect them to work - even if you pay for it. The reason is above: Thais can find a better boss or a better coworker in a day so people will just leave you with no notice if you're aggressive or rude. I've heard many stories of maids or employees leaving without even asking for their last pay - they value ''saving face'' more than money... Thais really value manners, patience and something they call ''jai-dee'' (being kind hearted). You see this everywhere you go - there is no honking in traffic (at all!!), if you bump into someone in a line, chances are that you'll both apologize to each other, no one smells on the trains (it is considered rude and onlly westerners do that), no one is loud in a restaurant... The streets are free of any broken glass because monks walk barefoot every morning when they are begging for alms... You have to see this place to believe that people can still live together while being nice to each other. Finally, the traffic is not dangerous at all. I am not sure where did that info come from. In Bangkok (as you'll confirm if you've been here), drivers don't change lanes like they do in Europe - as if driving a race car. Thais are very calm, non aggressive people so you can imagine that they don't turn into maniacs once they get into a car. The only danger are people who speed but even that is predictable and common sense - late at night, when roads are not crowded: use caution.... Simple. I've lived in all of Nomadlist top 10 cities. There is Bangkok and then there is the rest...",
      "Bangkok has some of the best private hospitals in the world. Which is interesting if you're in Asia a lot and you want medical care better than you can get in your home country.Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok is ranked #7 in the world. I did an executive health checkup there and it was great. Prices range from $250 to $750 depending on how many checks you want. You can get blood count, X Ray, ultrasound, hormone check, etc.They also have most other medical disciplines. I also got vaccinations renewed. The hospital is private so it's so much better than the overloaded public healthcare systems of Europe, Canada and UK where everyone tries to avoid helping you, is overworked and angry. In Bangkok they're super nice and helpful and you can make appointments straight with a specialist. Not blocked by a GP like in your home country.",
      "Bangkok is good for remote working. But you will feel it boring after 2 months.",
      "Over-hyped. Bangkok isn't what I was expecting. After a month in Thailand's capital, I couldn't wait to escape. Chiang Mai is far superior if you have a desire to stay in Thailand. It feels unfair to compare Bangkok to Saigon... Go to Saigon.",
      "Llargest expats and nomad community, cheap rent, cheap food, the best food city in the world, crazy night life, friendly people and city itself has a lot of energy.",
      "You get somewhat acclimated to the weather after a while (and yes, the right wool fabric is the most breathable one so ignore that previous reviewer). I've stayed here on and off for about 4 years now. The expat crowd is great and there really is a lot of opportunity for collaboration. Many networking events every month and a vibrant startup community. The variety of food is some of the best in the world (although you will have to pay to get quality Western). Shopping is great. Nightlife could be better but should satisfy most people. The real downside is the traffic which has become basically as bad as Jakarta, although Bangkok has much better transporation (both skytrain and subway). Living expenses have risen lately so don't count on this being a budget trip unless you want to resort to street food. Internet speed generally has becoming really great. Fast 4G in all operators. If you stay in a new condo or hotel you will average at least 30Mbit \u2013 my current co work place runs at 600.",
      "The weather is nice, a little bit too hot, but all these airconditioned spaces drive me crazy! Some people wear wool (!!) clothes at 32 degrees (facepalm). Noisy, griddy, but comfortable enough",
      "The way to approach Bangkok is to go from aircon to aircon. You wake up in an aircon apartment, you walk out into the aircon BTS or aircon Uber and arrive at the aircon cafe or aircon mall with aircon shops. If you think you can get out of the aircon and walk for longer than 5 mins outside, STOP! You can\u2019t, you\u2019ll turn into a wet towel of sweat. Nights are do-able in Bangkok though, good temperatures and no traffic. But when the sun rises, get back into the aircon!",
      "Bangkok\u2019s digital nomad community has grown rapidly due to its comparatively low cost of living and position as a bustling metropolitan city with great co-working spaces and high-speed internet. As it is popular with tourists and has a large expat crowd, foreigners are welcome and most people speak at least some English.",
      "The Shanghai of South East Asia. It's got everything from crazy nightlife, to hipster cafes and high-so venues."

    "Reviews": [
      "I was born and raised in Belgrade and all I can say is the city is very underrated. Been to many major cities in Europe, Northern Africa, and also lived for half a year in Los Angeles. I don't wanna sound as if I'm a big local patriot. I will try to be as much as genuine as possible.I completely agree with the fact that most places are full of smoke from cigarettes yet there are parts of the objects separated from smoking sections. This is available in many restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. You don't have to inhale smoke if you don't wish to. Also, one review on here complains about the highest lung cancers in this area -- I must admit this is not 100% accurate based on the statistics. You can't be sure about that info especially if considering that many places, in both country and the capital, left contaminated since the 1999 NATO bombing back. So it makes sense seeing rates being high within one part of the population. However, it's not an excuse for smokers and a bad living style.The nightlife is somewhat lower due to the Covid-19 crisis and local law regulations. Again, this doesn't mean all famous discos and bars are complete\u010dy gone. The riverside is still flawing with clubbing and you can have a great time if you know the right place to go.Now when it comes to people, local people here are very open and generous to foreigners. Hospitality is simply a part of our culture and we've known for this in the Balkans as well as the rest of Europe. We are also famous for helping people no matter where they come from. One of the reviews mentioned that waitresses will usually prefer to read a book or stare at their phones -- again, it also depends on the place you go, and in most cases, you will end up meeting a very friendly local waitress who will dive into a conversation with you whether you are a foreigner coming from abroad or a local pal that got lost in a different area. \"Coffee culture\" is very famous here and also a part of our culture. You can easily find a friend who will go out with you to a cafe or bar. In my opinion, the major difference between this part of the world and western society world is the fact people here are more honest and will not fake their feelings. This is why you will see dozens of different moods. In the western world, this is somewhat faked and one of the things I disliked. You will also make deep friendships here because people aim to make meaningful relations (not faked).In the last few years, the city has developed into a huge economic and IT hub. It has become an important place in this part of Europe (i.e. Ex Yugoslavia region to be more exact). There are lots of different places and activities you can do depending on your needs -- from walking in the parking zones and the riverside to hiking in smaller forest areas (I recommend Banjica forest). Most of the city center is walkable and turned into a walking zone -- you can easily walk away from the very center to the river. Also, the infrastructure is getting much better and even I can feel that for the 25 years spent here.To summarize, if you want to feel the real European vibe for a cheaper price (western standards), then this is a place to go. I also recommend staying in urban areas closer to the city center because this part has a special vibe easily noticed. The suburban parts of the city may seem way too different for foreigners and remind them of a typical Eastern European environment.",
      "My girlfriend and I lived in Belgrade for over a month and absolutely loved it! It has a bit of a raw feeling and the indoor smoking is something that's hard to get used to, but in general we felt welcomed with open arms with pretty much everyone we've been in contact with.We were particularly fond of the Dorcol region to stay, eat and live. The castle area is great for a walk on a sunny day. Also relevant in pandemic times: the food delivery is amazing (we mostly used Wolt).",
      "I stayed in Belgrade for over a week. I had high expectations based on the Nomad List ranking, but having been to every other capital in the Balkans, found it utterly disappointing.The city is not particularly walkable, the infrastructure is in a sad state, and there is practically no interesting architecture or urban development to speak of, be it historical, communist, or contemporary.Pollution is a real problem. To make matters worse, people smoke all the time, everywhere, including inside every cafe and restaurant.Health statistic confirm the point:- 2nd highest rate of lung cancer in the world- 4th highest rate of all cancer in the world- 1st highest rate of pollution-related deaths in Europe- 9th highest rate of pollution-related deaths in the worldThere are some nice cafes and restaurants through the city, but nothing wou can't find lesewhere in the region. Few have vegetarian options, and you'll get strange looks if you ask for tap water.",
      "I am from Serbia.People in Serbia are hospitable but if they do not know you by common friends or something they will treat you as an outsider in most cases, they will talk to you but not make friends etc.Even for serbs from other cities when you go to another city, Belgrade for example, it is difficult to make friends or people to go out with . It applies much more to foreigners. Why? I do not know, we are very hospitable in general but that's the way it is.Nightlife is not as good as it was, but it is good. Much better than in most of Europe. Cafes, restaurants and typical european culture is present at lower prices than for example in Denmark. The women are beautiful, some are stunning, I can say serbian women are among top 5 in Europe (along with russian, ukrainian, chech etc), men are often tall and good looking. Belgrade and Serbia are worth a visit especially if you are not from Europe and you can not afford more expensive western cities, but want to feel european lifestyle. In terms of hospitality, and good looking men and women you will get more then you would get in western Europe.",
      "I spent about a month in Belgrade, and visited other cities in Serbia, such as Smederevo. People are very kind, the prices are very cheap. It was pretty safe, and will probably go back and stay longer. Belgrade is a big and dynamic city. Currently, there are some buildings under construction in the center. There are places to visit and there are lots of history behind the city. I didn't like so much graffiti on buildings.",
      "I spent 4 months in Belgrade, putting myself out there quite a lot socially [PROS]- city center is quite nice, green with parks, and very walkable - low airbnb costs (but quality tends to be low as well) [CONS] avoid at all costs in colder months, every restaurant and bar becomes a cigarette hot box - nomad / expat community here is very small. only one legit co-working space (impact hub). - service in restaurants and shops is the worst I have ever experienced - night life is very overrated, none of the bars and clubs have open mingling areas / dance floors, they're just these tables everyone stands around and no one talks to each other Bottom line: Belgrade is a bit grungy but charming to walk around and explore for, I would say, a week or so. Socially, Serbia is quite a proud, inward-facing society. This, coupled with the small-to-nonexistant nomad community, can leave you feeling quite isolated.",
      "I spent 3 weeks in Belgrade (July 2019) to visit a friend who relocated. To be honest, while i've traveled somewhat extensively, and leave the USA on average three times per year, I had no idea what to expect in Serbia (Belgrade). I'd never been to Eastern Europe, let alone the Balkans. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly friendly just about everyone was. Everyone spoke english everywhere I went: cafes, restaurants, supermarket, taxis, shops, etc. My friend has very small children, and Belgrade is FULL of parks. The parks are routinely teeming with parents, as it seems there's some sort of a baby boom going on there. I was able to easily strike up friendly conversation with locals, who were extremely cordial. Even though I was there to visit friends, I spent the majority of my time alone exploring. I stayed in the city center, close to Republic Square. From there I could walk just about anywhere; the river, the mall on the other side of the river, waterfront, the old fort, etc. Taxis were extremely cheap, but often I just preferred to walk, even to Vracar from where I was in Venac , which is about a 30 minute walk, just because it was nice to experience Belgrade and people watch along the way. The AirBnb I rented had a functioning kitchen, and food in the supermarket is pretty cheap, but so is eating out (by American standards). I routinely had lunch or dinner with a drink, coffee and desert for anywhere from $11-18USD on average. I chose mostly to sit at any one of the countless open air cafe/restaurants twice a day, because it was so worth it. Is Belgrade the most exciting place on the planet? Probably not. At the same time, it's not boring either. I ended up loving the place. Between the people, the fact that I felt completely safe walking around by myself past midnight on many occasions, the great food, and typically European feel, I would definitely recommend Belgrade. Especially if you're not on a London/Paris budget, but want to experience Europe. People are much nicer also.",
      "I was in Belgrade a couple of days ago. Stayed there like 2 days. My Airbnb host was really welcoming and he offered some tips/advice regarding the best cheap prices in pubs + restaurants. The old center of Belgrade is really nice + it seems the same like Bucharest in some parts of it. Loved it and more than probably I will return to check it! Be carefull with gypsies near the bus/train station.",
      "A lovely city. But not the friendliest one.I travel extensively; 15-20 counties in the last 2 years. I'm friendly and very outgoing. But in my humble opinion, Belgrade (very generally speaking) is not a terrible friendly place for foreigners or solo-travelers.It is a beautiful, inexpensive and very safe city. Prices are fantastic, as is the food. But unless you come here with a companion...be prepared to have a rather lonely time. The local Serbs are not rude or actively unpleasant, and most everyone speaks English well.But most of the locals don't seem particularly open to having conversations with people they don't already know. In most of my travels, simply by being a foreigner in a cafe, restaurant or bar...you will, at minimum, at least be able to strike up a conversation with, say, your bartender or waitress. Here in Belgrade...not so much. For example: if you're sitting at the bar in a pub...the bartender, given a choice, will usually prefer to read a book or stare at their phone, rather than conduct anything more than a brief, monosyllabic conversation. It's pretty much the same in shops, restaurants, etc. And if you're used to striking up friendly conversations with fellow patrons at a restaurant, or bar, or art exhibition...don't expect that in Belgrade.Even the cashiers in the local grocery stores seem to prefer to keep interactions as brief as possible. Fake as it may be, there is something a bit comforting about the Western retail-facade of people pretending to be happy to see a customer...especially when you encounter the absolute lack of it for weeks on end.I'm not saying it's good or bad; it's just the way things are. I suspect it's at least somewhat cultural. I've gotten somewhat similar vibes in a few places in the Balkans and Eastern Europe before. I would not rate the locals of Budapest or Kiev as overly-friendly to outsiders, for instance...yet I found it far, far easier to meet and talk to people in those cities than in Belgrade.There are exceptions to the above. But I will stand by it as an accurate generalization, having been in the city for 3 weeks. Perhaps if you hook up with other travelers in some of the city's co-work-spaces, you might have a better time; I don't know.PS: I also think the \"Belgrade is famous for it's nightlife\" reputation is severely over-rated. That reputation might have been appropriate in the past; I heard from a couple of locals that, as of a year or so ago, a lot of new laws were passed restricting the operating-hours of most bars and clubs in the city. Most (not all, but definitely) places in the downtown area close up by midnight or 1am at the latest.With the exception of a couple of specific nightclubs...most of the city is pretty much a ghost town by midnight, even on the weekends.Again...a beautiful city, with lots of interesting culture, art and architecture. I think I'd likely love it if I came with someone I was dating. But for a solo traveler...it's genuinely one of the least-friendly cities I've ever been to.",
      "Overall: Lovely city (quite underrated)!",
      "Much, much more than expected.",
      "Not a good city for long-term stays. Nothing to see, very little to do. High air pollution. However cheapest capital in Europe and most friendly and warm people of all Eastern Europe / Balkans."

      "Doesn't matter what you're interested in, Saint Petersburg has it. It's the largest \"small\" city in Europe. Such a large population, but everything you want in nightlife and action is packed into several districts. Best city in Europe for nightlife. Not sure why nomadlist has \"safety\" as a con because it's safer than any western europe city and every american city. Cheaper than Thailand, but winter is COLD.",
      "Came 14 yrs ago from Germany for a visit - and stayed. Is 1 of most beautiful cities on earth, and I was almost everywhere in my younger days.- Cost of living extremely cheap if you know the basic rules.- Opened my own travel agency 10 yrs ago and pay only 6% taxes no matter how much I earn.- Average internet speed is 77 Mbit/sec.- Red tape is on the down side. You really need a Russian lawyer if you want to stay for years.- Winters can get very harsh, my lowest was -34 C in 2016.-",
      "Extremely beautiful and liveable city, not very expensive either, for the most part. People were very friendly too. Good public transport and working spaces (coffee shops, coworking spaces).",
      "Beautiful livable and active city, relatively cheap."

      "Krakow is a brilliant city to live and work from. Friendly, easy to get around (usually able to walk everywhere), great internet and busy nightlife. Really pretty city, too. Kazimierz, the old Jewish district, is the obvious place to live. Loads of great cafes and other digital nomads there.I was there during the summer when it was between 24 and 30 degrees each day, which is perfect. No doubt a different experience in the winter, though!",
      "Enjoyed Krakow. I was only there for 4 days which I think was perfect. It's a small big city with a beautiful old town square, great restaurants, fun sites, and good history. But if I stayed for a month or longer I believe it would have become a tad too small and boring for myself. Personally, enjoy Warsaw (where I have been for a month) more than Krakow if you're debating between the two Polish cities.",
      "Really enjoyed Krakow, it is the perfect 'small city'. Will definitely be returning!",
      "I visited Krakow 10 years ago and it was one of my favorite cities. This recent trip destroyed that memory. Very hard to find good wifi. Small city.",
      "Krakow is my favorite city !Cheap - you can buy a lunch in around 4$, and rent apartments in the center in around 600EUR. take an uber in less than 3 EURFriendly - The locals are very friendly and cool and easy to connect with. there is a lot of expats there so there is enough things to do. also i never had problem with language.. they all know english wellBeautiful - its one of the most beautiful cities i've been at - even more than prague.. everything here maintained like hundreds years ago and be in the old town is magicalClean - the city is extremely clean",
      "I lived in Stare Miasto for a year and loved it. As an American who doesn't speak the language I had no problem getting anywhere, felt safe the entire time and genuinely loved my time spent here. Internet was faster than anywhere I've seen in the US, the food was delicious, the nightclubs don't close until daylight and the entire City is inexpensive. Since I left it seems that racial tensions are growing and I'm hearing from Asian friends that they are being harassed more than ever before. I don't think is much of an issue if you're in the old town tourist area (Stare Miasto) as opposed to the more rural areas of Krakow...but for this reason I'm not going to move back anytime soon."

      "I lived in Central Warsaw on and off for about 1 year pre and post-pandemic. Central Warsaw is the \"New York of Eastern Europe\". Pros:- Very convenient, safe and clean.- Lots of modern, futuristic buildings. Easy to find nice apartments.- Very bike-able.- Not too expensive.- Lots of coworking spaces.- Some startup culture and quite a few meetups (pre-pandemic).- Polish women are beautiful.- Interesting history.Cons:- Not much of a nomad scene.- Coworking spaces have a rather corporate hustle vibe (WeWork, etc).- People aren\u2019t very open to foreigners. - Weather is quite bad most of the year. City is quite polluted.- Racism and homophobia is frequent,- Populist government.- Construction everywhere.I prefer the laid back vibes of Krakow more.",
      "I already living more than 1 year in Warsaw and i still think it's one of the best cities to live as a nomad as well.there is plenty of meetups to meet other expats, the people are nice, its cheap, its very big and not crowded, and very clean, pros: cheapeasy to make international friends , as there is many meetups great public transportplenty of cafes to work from warm and honest localsthe cons : Not many nomads, big city so some places far from each other .expensive cowork places (around 200-250eur a month for hot desk)",
      "I lived in Warsaw for 5 months and loved it! While it isn't as cool as warm countries like Portugal, Italy and Spain, it is very inexpensive and provides a high-quality life. The best thing is that the city is very active, with lots of things to do. I would have colder months though",
      "I'm there 5 month already, I love this city ! great and honest people great atmosphere and very cheap !there is many green areas and huge parks, good nightlife, and if you dance Latin (bachata, sals etc..) it have a huge scene. and if you single guy this city have the most attractive, easy going and beautiful ladies you even meet.",
      "Really enjoyed my time in Warsaw. Besides being cheap, it was beautiful, super liveable, and had a ton of great restaurants and coffee shops everywhere. Very active city with very friendly people. Almost everyone spoke English too which was nice.",
      "Loved Warsaw. The city has great vibes, nice people, a good nomad, and business community, delicious restaurants, fun nightlife, and extremely inexpensive in my eyes (coming from Miami, USA). Got a nice apartment near the city center with less than $600 USD/month and meals out/groceries are half if not a quarter of the price at home. Throughly enjoyed my month in Warsaw and will be back.",
      "Honestly, I enjoyed seeing more of WARSAW than KRAKOW. the 2nd biggest city in POLAND is not as spectacular or wider as the capital. Loved a lot the architecture + the prices in the old and new town (Stare MIASTO and Nove MIASTO). Good food in the center and you have a lot of things to see around there. Although it was pretty much reconstructed after the 2nd World War, the city still has a good shape with skyscrapers and old comunist architecture! :)",
      "I'm a nomad, but this is my city. I was born and raised here. I think it takes at least a few months to understand and feel this city. Because Warsaw has many many levels.",
      "Warsaw is incredible. Berlin-style nightlife is way more accessible, cheap, and friendly than \"Western\" Europe. Plenty of cafes, co-working spaces, and very very nice public libraries (registration is free! I highly recommend working there!) and overall an atmosphere of getting shit done. People are down-to-Earth, and if you speak English natively you will have plenty of work opportunities.",
      "One of the best cities I've been to. Much better then Berlin, Budapest, etc. so experiences can be quite different. I loved it.",
      "Cleanest city in Europe. Nightlife is big in my opinion, especially Mazowiecka. Also beautiful river with a lot of things to do during the summer.",

      "Even if the city is kind of on the decline, it still is awesome. Perfect weather all year, amazing food, vibrant local & expat community.",
      "Lived in Barcelona for a year and a half. I would agree that the weather is perfect and Barcelona does have a great tech scene as well as food and has everything landscape and lifestyle wise that you could think of. Bureaucracy isn't too bad if you nip it in the bu** early and have patience. Also, some clubs are free. (Jamboree!). The metro is also, very efficient with red and purple being the busiest lines. Very walkable city too. Plenty of opportunity to meet people as well. The beaches are ok, just avoid Barceloneta as it's pretty gross and you WILL get bugged by vendors and pick pockets. Not really any violent crime unless there is a reason for it. But ok, time for the negatives. Crime... it is not super dangerous I never felt unsafe. However, I almost got jumped twice and had gotten pickpocketed 3 times. One timed almost jumped because I was waiting for the night bus in a certain neighborhood (Reval) and the bus was taking forever. Once, I had two women of the night ;) sit next to me while waiting for the metro like, on both sides while noone else was there. And almost pick pocketed while on the metro going in run and dash method. Nothing ever happened or taken because I played it smart and didn't do any dumb tourist things but please be careful. Keep your cell phone in your FRONT pocket. Keep things in a secret pocket and don't put anything of importance in the front pockets of a backpack even if you hold it up front they have their ways lol. Also, Barcelona is mostly smoke and mirrors vibe wise. A lot of things you think are amazing or authentic are built purely for tourism and not authentic. Like, the \"Gothic Quarter\" for example. You can also entertain all of your vices here as well. Just be very very careful as Barcelona can swiftly drag you in and under. The Catalan people are courteous but not warm or friendly. If you want to thrive here you must learn Spanish AND Catalan. The only spanish speakers that are friendly are people from outside of Cataluyna but, quickly become on of them if from Spain so, your only bet are those from Latin America. And yeah, Barcelona is family friendly no problem. Just don't live in the Reval area unless you want break-ins. It's considered a hip place though despite that. And as a single person renting a room and using Cafe Wifi and going out for a drink once a week and buying bare minimal groceries; I would say I could live off of 700 euros bare minimum which, is kind of not enough if you ask me but it was ok. I could have found a cheaper room (Mine was 430 euros) but, alas I was desperate. However, Barcelona is amazing, with an art scene that is cool, a skater's paradise if that's your scene and many more. Just don't do dumb tourist things.",
      "Excelente ciudad para visitar y reune todas las cualidades para un n\u00f3mada digital, e visitado varias ciudades Espa\u00f1olas y sin duda Barcelona es la mejor.",
      "During winter is quite safe plus much cheaper. Some nightclubs are free and yet there is still a lot of people. Great por lgbtq+ community.",
      "I would disagree on the safety level of this city. Living there for 8 months now I'd say from my experience that Barcelona streets aren't safe at all. Many robberies, physical and sexual agressions are frequently occurring mostly due to drug issues in some central neighborhoods. I agree on the perfect weather great food and tech scene too on the positive side.",
      "great city - perfect weather , great food, great tech scene"

      "I stayed here for a month in July last year. There's lots of cool aspects to the city but I hated it when I was there. The city has a problem with British stag parties, so if you look like you're a British male and speak English expect to be treated with disdain (it's fair enough)The Hungarians can just generally be unfriendly, especially bartenders. It's a weird experience waiting to be served while 3 people ignore you. Or buying the same drink and getting charged whatever they want (700-1500huf).Pro tip would be to learn a little Hungarian to order, they swoon over that (450huf for your drink)The city is loud. You want to choose where you stay carefully. I was on a side street in the embassy district and it was quiet but I stayed a night in a hostel when I arrived and didn't sleep because at 4am there was a constant stream of sirens and noise.Supermarkets aren't 'cheap' but eating out ranges from affordable to great value.In summer it's hot. Like 36 degrees muggy polluted hot. Most places don't have aircon.Saying all that, I would like to give it another shot. I would probably stay on the Buda side and commute when I needed. The people on the Buda side are a bit nicer and in general it's more tranquil.",
      "I visited Budapest for a week and fell in love with it. Simply an amazing and beautiful big city complete with all the entertainment options (including walkability, stunning architecture and peaceful city parks).I decided to come back for 1.5 months to see if I wanted to make it a first or second home base. By the end of that time I was anxious to get back to Bangkok. All of the pluses were still great. However, there were two big downsides :1. The people in stores especially the middle aged women who looked like they were on the brink of committing suicide and the only thing that kept them going was the thought of making your shopping experience as miserable as possible. That said, I did find millenials who have grown up post the fall of the soviet union to often be very friendly and helpful. Maybe if I wasn't staying in the central area, which is a heavily tourist zone, I would have enjoyed the locals more.2. AirBnB and foreigners have driven many Hungarians out of the central area. I like living in an area that is mainly locals but has a minority of foreigners to spice things up somewhat. Otherwise, I feel I am living in an anywhereville. Some day I may go back and see if I can find a place a little farther out and check out that experience.",
      "I agree with the latest reviewer, BP is the Bangkok of Europe , especially in the summer when the temperature is between 35-40 C . Vasts of digitalnomader hubs& meetups and its very easy to build new relationships. It's dynamically getting more and more expensive because of the influx of the wealthy chinese hungarians. Also, many shared service centres come here from Western Europe.( That's why you can find a huge percentage of tech- minded young people here.). $1,500 is the lower entry to maintain a decent living here, I would rather say 2500. As a foreigner you have to pay at least $700- 800 per month for a one bedroom apartment. Do not be deluded by the local salaries which are relatively low because the government subsidizes the costs of housing for the native hungarians, and all the health services are free for them ( for these, as a foreigner you have to pay a lot)",
      "My girlfriend an I were here for 40 days for christmas, today we are leaving and our strongest sensation is that Budapest is so overrated.The main idea I arrived here with was that this was the cheapest capital in Europe. Not at all from our experience. For example we were coming from Edinburgh and there we spent less than here in groceries. Museums and attractions in general are not cheap. AirBNB is cheap here, mucho more than Scotland for example.Many people that work in bars, shops, etc here is almost offensive.Pros: Architecture, Metro 1 line, snow in winter, Danube :)Maybe because it was winter or because we are around 40s and we are not into parties, but IMHO there are so much better capitals in Europe like Prague, Edinburgh, Barcelona...",
      "I spent 54 days in Budapest and absolutely loved it. After Chiang Mai it's my favorite destination as a nomad.Pros:*Beautiful city*Super affordable*People are friendly and the majority of people I spoke with spoke English well*Tons of things to do from great night life to the hot baths, bike and walking tours and a vibrant food scene*No issues with internet and I was pleased with the co-working I worked out of (Kaptar). There are also some great coffee shops to work out of. My favorite is Flow, a few minutes walk from Octagon.*Weather was great until the start of November when it changed quite dramatically.*I had an amazing airbnb which I paid $1,050 for 30 nights. You can definitely find great places for cheaper.Cons:*At times I felt the streets were too crazy. The city has a ton of tourists and I can only imagine what it's like in the summer.*The Hungarians are heavy smokers. Thankfully there is no smoking indoors.*It got very cold and gray from the start of November. This had a bigger impact on me than I anticipated and negatively affected my experience. If you're like me and don't do well in the cold then I'd avoid Budapest from the start of November.Feel free to write me if you have any specific questions. My username on Nomadlist is @justin_butlion.",
      "The best city I've been too by a long shot! Only there for 7 days and fell in love immediately. Amazing vibe, tons to do, tons to see, beautiful city and the architecture is stunning all around you. The people are lovely and super friendly. The city is well kept. The only downside is that it's not warm all year around.",
      "I lived between Budapest and Szeged for a year. The public transportation and city vibes kept me alive while the winter weather almost killed me in winter. Definitely get out before it gets cold. Spring to Fall you can visit Lake Balaton and their wine country for some nature, Szeged or Pecs for a college town vibe, heaps of cafes and outdoor restaurants. The pastries and food markets. The thermal baths are great and not too expensive, great parks to visit, nightlife options, and music festivals. Cost of living is great when you're making US level wages, my roommates and I lived like kings and queens. Many locals are hostile towards foreigners, especially NGO expats (the wage gap is large between locals and expats). However, most are polite and some even cordial. The younger generation can speak English, the older generation cannot - based on my experience. The Hungarian language is a beautiful queer thing that I could never tire of. I loved it and would have stayed longer given the chance. Honestly - cannot wait to go visit and return to Hungary when I get a chance.",
      "The city is amazing: it combines beautiful architecture with an energy that rivals Berlin - minus the hipsters!Plenty of nice little coffee shops, co-working spaces, nightlife in abundance and all that at very affordable prices",
      "Great city that sucks you in. There is a true thing here called the \"BudAffect\". Many nomads/travellers come here for 4 weeks and then get sucked in for 6 months or longer. I personally came and after planning to stay for 1 month ended up staying for ~3 years. Now I am feeling the itch to travel again but Budapest has earned its place as \"home\" and I will return here after my next set of travels.",
      "Budapest + hungary has the pro-s of a tropical digital nomad hideaway, if you go there in the warmer months: the climate is like in Bali between June and September, however mornings can be refreshing. And there s a plethora of spas, thermal baths and swallow lakes with waterskiing and boarding amenities throughout the country which is easily and quickly accessible by the grid of well-maintained highways. The street scenery and style spans somewhere between Barcelona and Berlin so as the plentiful nightlife programs and the scope of culture and art ! Almost the entire younger generation speaks pretty good english however with the elders you might have language barriers.",
      "I'm from Bucharest but BUDAPEST is way beyond the best capital in comparaison with the romanian city. The scenery + the narrow streets & wide boulevards are full of interesting cafes/bars/pubs/restaurants. Prices are affordable/reasonable and you can take a chance with it.",
      "Have spent over 4 years living in Budapest and also extended periods in many other places usually towards the top of the rankings on nomadlist. Nothing compares to Budapest. It is by far the best place in the world to live for people of all ages, but especially young people. It has everything and anything you could possibly want and it's centrally located in the best continent on the planet.  I moved away for a few specific reasons but really hate that I had to. The only city I think is even close in comparison to how great Budapest is, is Barcelona.",
      "Very nice city, great architecture and many historical buildings. The river and castle at night are one of the best things to see in all Europe. Many Starbucks and other coffees in the city center with good Internet. Overall getting more expensive and touristy but still cheaper than Western Europe. People however are a dealbreaker there, most unfriendly cold and rude people of all Eastern Europe."

    "Reviews": [
      "Much nicer than people would have you think. Too many locals seem to be under the impression that it's the busiest, most expensive city in the world. These people clearly haven't travelled much. Not saying it's cheap, but for a big city in an English speaking country it's about what you'd expect, if not cheaper.Pros:- Hot humid summers, gorgeous orange autumns, cold snowy winters. If you like distinct seasons this is a great place to be. Winter is about 4-5 months, from Nov-Mar. Ignore everyone telling you it's 7+, total lie. - Lots of cool little neighbourhoods- Nice beaches that are actually in the city- Legal weed- Insanely multicultural- Great tenant rights (no security deposits and landlords can't stop you having pets)- Public transport is decent by North American standards- Good local salaries (though still way less than the US)- Cottage country- Loads of events going on- If you embrace winter you can have a lot of fun in the snow, ice skating, skiing etc.Cons:- People are pretty cold and hard to connect with- Big issue with people with serious mental health issues roaming the streets, like pretty much every city in NA- Everywhere outside of the downtown core is insanely boring- Nightlife is tame. If you like a few drinks in a bar it's good. If you like a proper night out you're better off visiting Montreal- Groceries are expensive as hell- Public transport is bad by European standards- Job market is extremely competitive due to mass immigration",
      "Literally the worst traffic in North America, 6th worst in the world, grotesquely expensive, Horrible weather much of the year, Cold and distant people. Possibly the most Anti-American people In the world. Surging crime and homelessness since Orwellian government lockdownOn a good note, decent waterfront in the summer and fall, if you dig around You can't find decent food though very expensive.Overall you're much better off in NYC or elsewhere. Trying to defect from here as asap.",
      "Not a bad city to check out. A bit on the expensive side but you can find some great communities here. Lots of international people, good tech scene and tons of stuff to do. I would give it a lukewarm recommendation",
      "Horrifically expensive, locals have very low social skills and emotional availability (after a year and a half here ALL my close friends were recent expats, and I generally meet 10-20 new people a day), and a 7-month winter sub-zero winter (up to -40 celsius) that leaves everyone increasingly overweight and miserable. Transit system is constantly under maintenance (~4 days a week?), and there is 0 traffic shaping in the city so it's always congested.",
      "As for safety this city has been changing for the worse. There are multiple shootings daily, culture is getting worse.",
      "Seems to be a really good place to live if you're fine with paying huge taxes for helping with inequality. However, it's definitely one of the expensive destinations for working remotely. Just consider the 4g price which is one of the highest in the world.",
      "One of the friendliest people in the world. People are very polite and considerate."

      "How did you guys classified Penge as rich? It is one of the worst neighbourhood I have ever been in London, the ammount of people I know that have been robbed there is appalling.",
      "London is a SO beautiful city. The historical center is cute, but also majestic and luxurious. You feel the culture at every step. British people are really kind and welcoming! Plus, more than just one, you can enjoy TWO skylines \ud83d\ude0d so many skyscrapers, nothing beats its collection in Europe.",
      "London is the best city in the world - you just can't do it on a budget. It's got an amazing tech scene but ALSO world class media, fashion, finance, art industries and many others. If you don't want to live in a tech / expat mono-culture then it's for you. It is a genuine melting pot with a huge range of nationalities and cultures living together (the US has a large number of nationalities but there seems to be hard segregations between them geographically, economically, culturally - so they don't mix). The downside is definitely the cost - If you want to live in London you might want to consider getting a London job - so that your income will match the expenses - there's loads of demand for developers (along with most other job types). I also want to address the strange stereotype perpetuated by Americans that the food is bad - which is laughable having toured North America extensively and found the food to be dire. London has more Michelin star restaurants than nearly anywhere. The food markets are amazing as are the cafes, restaurants and pubs. Again you'll need to pay what everyone else pays to get good food so don't expect to do this on a shoestring.",
      "I've been living in London for most of my life. I still do not understand the hype for this city. It's wildly expensive, unfriendly, polluted and with the worst weather I've ever seen. It's not only cold - the sky is constantly plain white, it's always just cold enough to make you uncomfortable, and it's humid. It's like stepping on a piece of paper, zero personality. If you've never felt depressed before and want to know what that's like, come to London, you'll be googling therapists within a few days. Should I continue? The skyline is ugly, the river is murky brown, it's too crowded to move, and people don't care about you. What are these \u00a3600 apartments people are talking about? Lol - try over \u00a31500 for anything that's better than a cardboard box in a terrible area. I guess you can visit for a few days to tick it off your bucket list, but I'd reconsider any plans to live here longer term. My only benefit of having lived in London is that any place is better and cheaper in comparison.",
      "I have been living in London for over 2 years as a student. It's ridiculously expensive. However, there are options. What I like about the city is you can find many events anytime you want. It's active all year 24/7. There are so many foreigners and tourists which make the living more vibrant and less racist. London has sub-communities which I think is a good thing. Those communities bring their cultures, ethics and foods. Public transportation and restaurants are great. I used to spend 3-4 hours in Costa or Nero cafe without interruptions. Though if it's raining or summer season it could be hard to stay long. On the negative side, the UK suffers from slow and old bureaucracies making life difficult sometimes. It's not easy to open a bank account or to rent. The government systems are slow. Also, you will feel depressed in winter when the sunset is before 4pm and the temperature is 0c. All in all, everything is great about the city except the affordability and the winter.",
      "Although London isn't an ideal 'digital nomad' city due to the cost, it is very much made for working, networking and having a great time while you do it. Rent is silly expensive, but you can find a room in a shared house for around \u00a3500-600 per month. One review on here complains about bad food, unsafe and bad banking - sounds like they had a bad time to be honest. I disagree strongly with all those negatives. Food is awesome, with lots of incredible places to eat and reasonable (ish) prices. Head to Brixton, Brick Lane, Hackney/Dalston, Tooting etc for top quality food. For your banking, you'll find Revolut, Monzo, Starling etc all allow you to get set up in a few days. Oh and safety.... I've lived here for 7 years (on and off) and been drunk in 'dodgy' parts of town and can say London is one of the safest cities anywhere. Can't say the same for Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona etc.",
      "I do not recommend London for nomads. It's very hard to find places to work in London. Cafes don't like people with laptops, there won't be any power outlets and you'll get funny stares from staff. That's because London is expensive, and it's a loss for cafes to have you. Flexible coworking is hard to come by and day passes are very expensive. That makes it practically impossible to work properly in London as a nomad.",
      "Expensive and crowded. Low quality of services. Customer service is a joke. Great internet connectivity. Mediocre food, unless you like Indian, which is everywhere. Crappy weather. Not safe at night (depends on the area of course). I lived in Docklands, didn't feel safe outside of my apartment. Difficult to get anything done without proof of address, so make sure to get a place as soon as possible. Opening a business account in a \"traditional\" bank can take weeks. Banking is very backward - unless you enjoy browsing PDF statements... I honestly don't understand why London is so popular. I was deeply disappointed and left after a few months. The only real upside is the job market, but as a nomad, you can provide services to London-based businesses from somewhere else.",
      "London is an amazing city but it's eye-wateringly expensive, don't expect to save money...Expect to be paying a minimum of \u00a3600/month for a bedroom in a shared house (and for this price you'll be in zone 2/3). Look on spareroom for houseshares and openrent for flats. Download the app Citymapper to help you get around it's a godsend - London is a massive city and it can take ages to get from one place to the next. There's tonnes of cafes, workspaces and public spaces to work in (Google campus, Barbican, Southbank centre etc). World class food, world class culture, people from all over the world! Liberal city, mostly safe... Bad air quality though.Don't come here thinking you can do it cheap as you will end up in a 10 person houseshare with a dodgy landlord and be stuck in some crap area of town. It's a hard, ruthless and expensive city to break into, plus we have a population of over 8.6MILLION so competition is tough. There's start-ups on every corner so plenty of people in similar situations.Just factor in the cost and be willing to stay for a while (so you can properly embrace the city) and you'll have a blast.",

Flexible coworking is hard to come by and day passes are very expensive. That makes it practically impossible to work properly in London as a nomad. It's a city where lots of people are scraping by cooped up into tiny shared housing with skyhigh rents, lots of superficial tourists and a few rich people."

    "Reviews": [
      "I like S\u00e3o Paulo, but I don't love it. It's pretty boring in my opinion. Probably because I love Buenos Aires so much and it just does not compare. Also for the 4 months (September - January) I was there, it was cold, overcast, and rainy 85% of the days. It was pretty depressing!Other than that, it's pretty safe overall for Latin America. Also, I really appreciate how people here take COVID more seriously than in a lot of other places in Brazil.If I had to do it again, I would stay near Ibirapuera Park - it's so beautiful.",
      "Amazing place, and kind of a futuristic city!! Public transportation is also great, especially the subway.",
      "A particularly interesting city to make business (Brazil is the strongest economy in Latin America). I recommend learning some basic Portuguese to really network and connect with the people; Brazilians might party openly with foreigners, but reserve the most interesting parts of their culture to Portuguese speakers.",
      "Sao Paulo is a great city, one of the biggest in the world and has everything you'll ever need. Compare it with New York without all the glamour and you have it",
      "Never written a review before but I've been to most of the top cities on Nomadlist and they're all pretty good.... however, Sao Paolo is a fine city, typical for Latin America, but it doesn't belong at #7 (as of this writing) :) There's just nothing especially interesting about it compared to other cities.",
      "Greatest city to be a nomad in Brazil by far. Low crime rate when compared to Rio, 4G works great in a lot of places and what you can have the most is fun here. Cost of living can be a little too high if you don't pick carefully a place, but people are friendly and help you to find the perfect place. Ah, and food here is delicious, even if you're a vegan."

      "I've spent a few months in Tenerife in 2020. I think it's the best of the Canary Islands for remote workers. The South has better weather and more touristy vibe, the North is colder but with more long-term people. Nomads seem to be living around El Medano, Puerto de la Cruz or Las Americas.Pros:- Lots of nomads. Seems to be a good solution for those who have to remain in EU timezones or just starting out they nomad journey and don't want to take too much risk.- Awesome weather.- Nature. Surfing, kitesurfing, diving, hiking, mountain biking and all kinds of outdoor activities are great on the island.- Decent public transport, nice roads, generally good infrastructure.Cons:- Zero hipster cafes that are good for work.- Very few co-working spaces.- No ride-hailing apps. You have to make a phone call to book a taxi like it's 2005. Best to get a car or motorbike.- Online shopping can be a hassle due to the distance from the mainland.- Difficult to find high quality accommodation, even if you have the money to burn.- Lots of drunk retired British expats and businesses catering for them.Overall, I think Tenerife is great and has great potential at becoming an \"European\" nomad hotspot -- if it isn't one already.",
      "WOW, cool platform. Even for freelancers like me. I am currently staying on a beautiful finca (Finca San Juan) in the north of Tenerife. The climate is amazing. It is not too hot and sometimes partly cloudy and still it is green and very calm and quiet. The Finca is in San Juan de la Rambla (Hotel Finca San Juan) and provides super fast 600 MBit fiber with strong WIFI broadcast on the whole premise. It consists of some complexes to rent for long-term with a huge discount and a lot of included Services. It has many chillout areas to withdraw and even isolate a bit. Also it has a big pool and showers, restaurant, bar and a projector to give seminars. The island is full of other facilities to live and work, but I like this the most and I will stay here until end of February. Hit me a message to Dave Travolta in one of the social networks. I am usually up for brainstorming session or social drink.",
      "We spent January in Santa Cruz and had a fantastic stay. The people we met were nice, the weather was fantastic, prices for things were reasonable, good selection of locally grown produce, good internet connectivity, there were lots of outdoor activities to do, and not too touristy or crowded (at least Santa Cruz in January). Other parts of the Island felt more resort-like and it wasn't so easy to get to places outside of Santa Cruz without a car.",
      "If you live in the south of the islands, the temperature is never under 20 degrees during winter time, so eternal spring \u00a1\u00a1",
      "Tenerife is really a great place for nomads! we've stayed here for a bit over 3 months and loved everything about it! in my opinion the north is more authentic and has way more to offer to nature lovers than the south. We stayed at an amazing coliving in la Orotava (nine coliving) and I would definitively recommend this place! The nomad community is pretty active as well and several events are organized monthly which is nice!"

      "Chiang Mai used to be N.1 for the digital nomad life.It is still great and you can find really cheap apartments (300-400$) and restaurants (2-3$ for a main).Wouldn't recommend staying there during the burning season.The best area is Nimman, but it's also the most expensive. You can stay in the old city that's very nice but that gets noisy during the weekend for the night markets.Last but not least, very safe city.All in all would go back in a heartbeat.",
      "A solid spot to live and work remotely. Plenty of things to do and relaxed quality of life. Many places to work from. Downsides are the lack of sidewalks makes walking around town uncomfortable. Also the traffic is very bad.",
      "It\u2019s the cheapest digital nomad friendly spot in the world, that is also nice and convenient. Although the earlier reviews do point out the issue of air quality and transportation. the local food is great plus there\u2019s a variety of world class restaurants, there\u2019s nature and lots of places to see that aren\u2019t tourist spots, loads of coworking spots and cafes, .. but it\u2019s also just boring enough to be a good spot to settle down and focus on work.. plus month to month rentals are super common here, can show up at many places and rent a room for a month",
      "I have to agree with previous review from 6 days ago. Its definitely not like before- the vibe has definitely changed. I have lived here on/off for the past 2 years on METV visa, 60 Day visa, and now its not worth staying and dealing with the hassels. Infrastructure is terrible with dirty roads, definitely not a walkable city which is a shame since the Nimman area could have been a walking street, but cars and scooters dominate this city. Just try to cross and walk the streets and you will see what i mean- no mercy! I no longer feel CM is a good digital nomad city, its gotten way too inconvenient with visa's, dirty polluted air, smokey season as of Jan, just not a nomad paradise. If you're traveling alone single ladies- dating pool is terrible- Vietnam could be the better choice or Eastern Europe as a base. Good Luck.",
      "Chiang Mai has THE WORST AIR QUALITY of any city in the world for >= ~2 months every year (Google \"burning season\"). So impossible to ever live here permanently, even if you like the place. Also, Thailand is now cracking down on people using back-to-back visas or visa free entries to stay as well (just Google for it on the forums). It was getting harder and harder to stay (before I left) and the vibe wasn't as good as it used to be. Most people have moved onto Vietnam, which is much easier to stay in, much more up-and-coming, and where the authorities are much friendlier towards digital nomads.",
      "I have been told it's the vanilla of digital nomads : easy, cheap, risk free. I loved it so much I want to move there ! Great food, great places to see and awesomely polite and nice people.",
      "Can't recommend it enough. Been a nomad now for 2 years and this ticks a lot of boxes. Great quality people you meet here compared to the rest of Thailand.",
      "Great place. You can avoid the dropshipper, FBA and MLM webinar course people who have infested the coworkings here for years, by, well, just not visiting the coworking spaces here.",
      "Great place. Very easy to live here.Every self confessed \"Digital Nomad\" in Chiang Mai is borderline psychotic/delusional. Luckily, they're easy to avoid. Stick with the expats, locals, and tourists and you'll meet some great people. My second digital nomad pick after Saigon.",
      "I really can't see what's cool here. The air is highly toxic, the old city is charming but outside of it there is so much traffic it's so noisy and you can never cross the streets. If you don't have a sccoter it's super annoying to go from a point to another quickly. No real transports. The coworking places or made of unfriendly western people.",
      "Why Chiang Mai? Because it's the easiest place to live of anywhere IMO. You can afford everything, you can do everything, you can access everything, and everything is available. It's very very low stress place compared to everywhere else, which is one of:- expensive (north america)- cold (europe)- terrible food (most places)- terrible airbnb/apartments (most places)- no modern amenities available like apple store, mall, normal shops (bali)- awful local transport (bali)- not easy to get around with just english (europe)Chiang mai is just the \"everything is easy\" nomad capital which means I can focus on work and not be stressed out about everythingactually my only complaints about Chiang Mai are:1. bit boring, not THAT much to do2. hard to find normal humans to hang out with who aren't delusional dropship scammers trying to escape real life",
      "Spent a little over 2 months in CM. Loved it. A little bit annoyed with the hippy western backpackers who suddenly becomes more Thai than the Thai's themselves with their ridiculous elephant pants, but you can easily look past that. Still way too many dodgy dropshippers and FBA bros hanging out at the coworking spaces, but with the abundance of hipster cafe's serving great coffee for 80 baht you don't even need to go to a coworking space to get stuff done.Regardless, I'm definitely going back. It's a fantastic place to be productive, meet cool people and enjoy Khao Soi.",
      "Chiang Mai is a gas chamber. The smokey season starts beginning of January and goes on till end of May. But apart of that: the air is bad year around. The city has grown too fast. Pity because Chiang Mai is a fantastic place!",
      "I just got back here in late 2018 and it's better than ever. People who say \"Chiang Mai is overrun by nomads\" are really mistaken. I hardly saw them. I did see lots of Chinese and some Korean tourists, but they were all quite nice and mostly around Nimman. There's also the few American vegan midlifer's in the Old City center, but that's about it. Chiang Mai is cool and breezy, there's now public bicycles literally everywhere that you can rent for 250 THB or $6 (per month!) with the MoBike app. The red buses (or Songthaew's) are now legit and don't rip tourists off anymore, so you can drive everywhere for 30 THB or $1. People are nice. It's still super safe, even late a night. The food is better than ever. And thanks to the nomad wave of 2014 in Chiang Mai, there's now lots of hip cafes that allow coworking too. It's a great city.",
      "It's no surprise that Chiang Mai is currently the top city for digital nomads to live and work in. It has the far lowest cost of living in comparison to other cities, including low rent for decent apartments. With a variety of great co-working spaces on the rise, not to mention the number of coffee shops with decent Wi-Fi, you'll be spoilt for choice.",
      "The city where digital nomadism essentially started. There's no other place where you can walk out of the airplane, get a cheap place to rent, find a boutique cafe to work, and then meet locals and nomads in the same day. Some people say it's overrun by nomads, which is fair. But it still remains one of the best places to start out."

      "Prices aren't that low anymore. 1br apartment in the centre would cost you around 400 euros, maybe even 500 if you go for something more luxurious.Airbnbs are 40-50 euros per night (central ones).Dinner would be anywhere from 5 to 10 euros and even more if you go to the fanciest restaurants.There's a decent tech scene around (lots of software engineers in the city).I'm living in Timisoara since 2011.",
      "Timisoara is an interesting place. The centre square is where it all happens. We stayed a couple days to break up our journey in Romania. Lots of cafes and restaurants. It\u2019s very safe, apart from the occasional person asking for money. English in the centre is pretty well spoken, but out of that, it\u2019s hard to find an English speaking/understanding person. If in real trouble go talk to youth, they will be beat option. The food is quite good and beer is cold. The cost was very reasonable too. 6.5/10 is a pretty fair score I\u2019d say."

      "Stayed one month in January. In which it is one of the few places in the EU with absolute tshirt-weather. I liked the nomad and expat scene, which is lively. There's always something to do: sailing, markets, tapas nights, meetups. The transport system is good, with a cheap city bike system, good bus system for island travel and ferries for inter-island travel. Each island is a bit different in climate and culture so go and see a few. I especially liked the hiking in different micro-climates. For downsides the Canary Islands are very touristic including complete Swedish/German/English neighbourhoods in some beachside places. Though you can easily avoid these. Even though the islands are quite small, car drivers still race around maddeningly. So try and find your bed away from main roads. My personal recommendation would be to base in Las Palmas, where the expats are, and do some excursions from there.",
      "There's a good nomad scene here. I think the city is under rated on this website. Weather good all year, safe, friendly locals, good internet (I have fiber 600mb in my apartment) and it's affordable compared to many cities. There's a community facebook page that is quite active with events organised every week - Gran Canaria Digital Nomads. Check it out you won't regret it ;)",
      "Amazing place! cheap and beautigul. Stay in the south!"

      "I stayed in Cape Town for 5 months and loved every minute of it. The work life balance is fantastic, after work there's the beach or countless options to walk or hike, everything accessible from the middle of the city. Wifi is so so, but never had an issue to work with a sim card / mobile phone hotspot as a backup. So many great restaurants and coffee shops. I mostly worked from coffee shops, but there are also lots of co working spaces. Safety is an issue, yes, but you just have to be smart (ie don't walk alone after dark, don't flash your valuables). Got myself a pepper spray and had it with me at all times, but I'm more vulnerable as a solo female. Best neighborhoods to stay in are Sea Point and Green Point. I'm on a German salary and found it pretty cheap. People are super friendly. It's one of the greatest l cities in the world to me and I will certainly go back.",
      "Beautiful place but the crime is really bad. You can't really enjoy it at night and you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings. Im not sure how this ended up in the top 10 on NomadList.",
      "Currently living here. There is lovely nature but unfortunately tons of litter every where. Good restaurants which you can only enjoy in the day because of crime, not wise to go out at night. Internet is also often not fast or not at all with load shedding happening. Load shedding is when they switch electricity off. From a money point of view I don't find it cheap. Only the eating out part is cheaper than Vienna.",
      "Totaled almost 4 months here last year. Amazing nature and hiking nearby if that's your thing - you should definitely consider visiting. Probably most beautiful city on Earth. The wealth divide can be depressing and there are serious issues with crime, but with some vigilance and street smarts you can mostly avoid it. It is also a surprisingly affordable place and has some great food options.",
      "~1 year ago I lived here. There's plenty of things to do with the most beautiful nature nearby and lots of cafes to work from with decent wifi. Sadly crime is bad, don't go out when it's dark and in certain areas or you will get at a minimum robbed.",
      "Love Cape Town as a DN. Been here 3 months - mountains, city, ocean, animals, hiking, super affordable, great foodie scene and safe (if you're smart). https://www.tech4trek.com/cape-town-digital-nomad"

      "They say you get what you pay for. After having traveled the previous 4 months in India, Cambodia, VietNam, Myanmar and Thailand, Singapore was so easy! The subway system is a marvel, streets signs were easy to read, everyone speaks English (that just makes it easy for me as an English speaker) it is safe, clean, and parks are gorgeous. I was there as COVID 19 was breaking out fairly fast and that put a damper on my time but I was so happy to be there anyway and plan to go back. For digital nomads if you can afford accommodation this is a very easy city in which to stay awhile. The internet was strong and consistent everywhere I went. If order, safety, and ease of transport is high on your list Singapore can be a great place to land for awhile.",
      "Clean and modern city state. Singapore is clean, modern and Singaporeans are friendly and internationally minded. It has skyscrapers, green parks and food courts. It's a country that exists by the grace of globalization and internationality. Anyone can feel home here as the country is a collection of ethnic Chinese, Malay, Indian and a whole bunch of expats from anywhere. Singaporeans are highly educated, smart and professional. Singapore is a great place for incorporating your remote startup and do banking from there. It's a great place for dating because there's lots of internationally minded high educated high income and somewhat progressive young people. The only bad things you could say are that 1) Singapore is expensive. I don't deny that. But it's because it's a first world country in a continent of third world countries, 2) That's it not completely free. There's limits to political freedom of speech in favor of a more stable government. If I agree with that, I don't know. But it is stable, 3) That it's too hot and humid. Singapore is on the equator. Luckily they have A/C pretty much anywhere. And they have tunnels under the city to walk that are also A/C'd. Nice.",
      "Easiest subway system to master. Everyone lives within 10 minutes walking of a major greenspace. 90 percent home ownership. People believe in the laws the government writes. Offices are VERY QUIET.",
      "It truly is a garden city - the amount of green space is mindboggling. Everywhere you go it's green and amazing. One of my favourite cities anywhere.",
      "Everything just works. The food by Singaporean Hawkers are world-class for a good price too. \ud83d\udc4c",
      "The Diet Coke of Asia. Zero crime, English spoken everywhere. Reliable public transport. Some nice spots for off-the-beaten-path walking and hiking. But also clinical, authoritarian, money-minded and very costly. Companies and shopkeepers will always do what's good for them (or makes their own life easier); not what's good for the customer. People avoid eye contact and are generally overworked and miserable. After a while, crossing over to Malaysia's neighboring Johor will, warts and all, feel like a breath of fresh air (\"Yes! Space! I can move! I can breathe!\").",
      "Nomad-ed here for a month. A totally ok place if you have the budget for it. Coworking spaces are good, 4g everywhere, transportation is effective. Lots of things to do. I was able to find friends. Lots of international people, very few digital nomads. If you're there, consider not renting in the center (as it gets expensive fast) and being creative with places to eat to find cheap options. Be prepared to use cash unless you live in a luxury."

      "I visited Prague on more than one occasion and tried something new each time. I really wanted to enjoy it, but unfortunately it turned out to be one of my least favourite cities. Perhaps it was just me, but there was an overwhelming sense of distrust and dislike towards foreigners, you have to try pretty hard to blend in if you want to experience the life of a local & avoid the tourism. I met some wonderful people and and there\u2019s some cool communities to be part of, but another extended stay just isn\u2019t for me.",
      "My husband and I spent about 6 weeks testing Prague in Nov-Dec 2018 as we were considering it as a semi-permanent base of operations for the next year or two. Honestly it was great and we plan on leaving Malta where we have been for the past year. Pluses - transportation is very good and quite cheap, tons of restaurants, lots to do. People are more reserved, perhaps even a bit suspicious, so I would not say it was an OVERLY welcoming vibe, however there are a lot of expats from the US, CA, UK and more, so I did meet some very nice people and there is a good Expat network there. Not very racially diverse, I noticed this very quickly. Language is somewhat of an issue - unlike say France or Spain where you can figure out some words - in Czech you won't have a clue. Overall though - 2 thumbs up for us!",
      "Possibly the best city to live in Europe, especially in the summer. It's clean, people are friendly, lots of cafes to work, fast internet, lots of Airbnb's, and it's relatively cheap.",
      "Prague is super awesome, it\u2019s a very beautiful city. However, I have learned two things about Prague which I want to share with future travelers and nomads, they are:- Only use ATMs that has the word \u201cBankomat\u201d on it, all the other ATMs have really high fees or commission and may even in some cases support organized crime.- if you need to call the police for some reason, because of e.g. robbery or physical injury, make sure to call the state police or ask for the state police and not the municipal police. The municipal police can be very corrupt and in some cases support organized crime. That\u2019s my advice, take care."
